These applications were developed to overlay the DAQA dataset (completed projects) with socioeconomic data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Queensland Government Statistician's Office (QGSO) and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). Factors include GDP, overseas migration, interstate migration, employment and buildings approved. Most measures are specific to Queensland.

As data is recorded in two forms, by calendar year and financial year, we have developed two applications to explore the data. Applications can be accessed using the following links:

**By calendar year**: [https://daqa-socioecon-cy-dashapp.onrender.com](https://daqa-socioecon-cy-dashapp.onrender.com)

**By financial year**: [https://daqa-socioeconomic-fy.onrender.com/](https://daqa-socioeconomic-fy.onrender.com)
